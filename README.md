# sleep-detection
identify if the driver is asleep or not using eyeblink pattern. 
Here we use the Dlibs68 facial landmark model and calculate the closing of eyes using EAR ratio.If the eyes are closed for more than the prescribed threshold then an alarm is iniated - that is done by connecting a buzzer to a node mcu and creating a cloud that connects the input from computer to the nodemcu.This project is done in a simple manner in which we implemented this eye blinking analysis in computer itself
